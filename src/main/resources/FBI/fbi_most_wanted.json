Pratt and a co-conspirator owned and operated a pornography production company and online pornography websites, \"GirlsDoPorn\" and \"GirlsDoToys.\" Pratt and his co-conspirators allegedly recruited young women from around the United States by posting advertisements for clothed modeling jobs on the Internet. Pratt and his co-conspirators advised the women responding to the ads that the jobs were in fact for pornographic videos and that they would be paid between $3,000 to $5,000 U.S. dollars for a one-day video shoot. To persuade the women to participate, Pratt and his co-conspirators allegedly convinced the women they would remain anonymous, that their videos \u200bwould be provided to private collectors on DVD, and would not be posted on the Internet. Pratt allegedly paid other young women working at his direction to act as references or provide false assurances to the women that, if they filmed a video, the video would not be posted online. Some \u200bwomen were not permitted to leave the shooting locations until the videos were made \u200band \u200bothers were allegedly forced to perform certain sex acts they had declined to do. Allegedly, some of the women were sexually assaulted.  \u200bPratt's pornography websites generated more than $17 million U.S. dollars in revenue.  A federal arrest warrant was issued for Pratt in the United States District Court, Southern District of California, on November 6, 2019. <\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>",

The victim attempted to defend himself and punch back before Dominguez allegedly produced a handgun and fired multiple rounds, ultimately killing the victim.<\/p>\r\n<p>Dominguez fled the scene and is believed to be in Mexico.<\/p>\r\n<p>Dominguez was charged with murder by the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, and a state warrant was issued for his arrest on January 26, 2018. A federal arrest warrant was issued by the United States District Court for the Central District of California on February 2, 2020, after Dominguez was charged federally with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.<\/p>",

The 5 individuals are alleged to have conspired to steal \u201cinbred\u201d corn seed from Dupont Pioneer, Monsanto, and LG Seeds. This \u201cinbred\u201d or \u201cparent\u201d line of seed constitutes valuable intellectual property of a seed producer.

During the argument Villarreal allegedly pointed his gun at both men, who then fled the store. A short time later, Villarreal, while in his pickup truck without his daughters, found the two men a short distance from the store. Villarreal then allegedly shot both men, wounding one and killing the other.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>Villarreal was charged with murder by the Superior Court of Los Angeles, County of Los Angeles, California, and a state warrant was issued for his arrest on June 11, 2010.

Reports in this case allege the following: On July 5, 1997, Francisco Molina-Neave and his girlfriend attended a holiday party in the Denver Metro area. While driving home from the party, Molina-Neave, who was seated in the front passenger seat, began punching his girlfriend as she was driving. She stopped the car and pulled over. Molina-Neave got out and walked around to the driver\u2019s side of the car where he continued to beat his girlfriend.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>The assault continued until a passer-by showed up and ran over to the girlfriend. Molina-Neave then fled the area. The passer-by flagged down a vehicle occupied by additional witnesses who reportedly saw the beating. The passer-by asked the witnesses in the car to attempt to locate the suspect. They agreed to help and spotted Molina-Neave a short distance away. They told Molina-Neave to stop and that they had called the police. The suspect fled down an alley as police arrived. While setting up the perimeter the police heard two gunshots fired from the alley where the suspect was last seen. The gunshots were fired by two different guns. The officers observed the witness vehicle speed out of the alley. The witnesses were screaming that the same suspect, along with another Hispanic male, had allegedly shot at them and their vehicle. One of the occupants in the vehicle was screaming that she had been shot as well.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>On January 21, 1999, a jury found Francisco Molina-Neave guilty on charges of first degree assault, attempted first degree assault, prohibited use of a weapon, and third degree assault. Molina-Neave fled from the courtroom as the verdict was read. A warrant was then issued for his arrest. On May 17, 2006, Francisco Molina-Neave was arrested on the warrant from Denver in San Antonio, Texas. He refused extradition, and a Texas court allowed him to post bond pending his extradition appeal. The suspect failed to appear and was arrested in mid-May of 2007. The Texas court set his bond for one million dollars. Molina-Neave posted the bond and was released. His appeal was denied on October 4, 2007, and he fled again. On March 13, 2008, a federal arrest warrant was issued for Molina-Neave, and he was charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.<\/p>",

            "caution": "<p>Scott A. Kohn of Newport, California, and Future Income Payments, LLC (FIP), an entity organized under the laws of Nevada, are charged with conspiracy to engage in mail and wire fraud. According to the indictment, it is alleged that FIP operated a ponzi scheme in which it actively recruited pension holders who were desperate for money, including many veterans of the United States Armed Forces. The pensioners allegedly made monthly payments to FIP in exchange for a lump sum payment or loan. The adjusted annual percentage rate on these transactions often exceeded 100%. FIP then solicited investors to purchase \"structured cash flows,\" which were the pensioners' monthly pension payments. FIP promised the investors a rate of return between 6.5% and 8%. It took active steps to conceal from the investors the usurious nature of its transactions with the pension holders. FIP diverted new investor funds flowing into the business to fund payments to earlier investors in order to keep the scheme operational. When FIP ceased doing business in early 2018, investors were owed approximately $300 million. The scheme alleged in the indictment victimized over 2,600 individuals.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>On May 12, 2019, a federal arrest warrant was issued by the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina after Kohn was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and mail fraud.<\/p>",

From 2002 until 2005, Oliver used fraudulent business licenses and induced clients to make payments for work which was never completed.   Oliver was released from jail on bond, but violated his release conditions and a warrant was issued for his arrest on December 6, 2005. Oliver failed to appear in court on January 20, 2006, as scheduled, and was sentenced in absentia to 20 years in Federal prison.  It is believed that Oliver fled the Fairfax, Virginia, area in November of 2005.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>Oliver is also wanted for probation violation in 1995 which followed a securities fraud conviction in Arlington County, Virginia.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>On September 19, 2016, the FBI received information suggesting that Oliver and his wife, Jennifer Oliver, were living and conducting business in the Los Angeles, California, area, to include the cities of Culver City and Gardena, California.  Investigators believe that Oliver was alerted to some recent publicity and fled once again.  Upon arrival at a possible business location, law enforcement officials were advised that the couple had been there earlier the same day to pick up a check and mentioned they were leaving town, possibly to Georgia. The FBI believes that the couple may also have ties to Nevada.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>",

On January 8, 2006, the men, both members of the MS-13 street gang, were at a club in South Baltimore when they met the two male victims. It is believed the murders occurred because the suspects thought they saw one of the victims flash a rival gang sign. Law enforcement investigation revealed that the victims had no gang affiliation. When the two victims left the club, they were approached by the suspects and agreed to meet them behind a local school. The two male victims were then stabbed multiple times with knives and died.<\/p>\r\n<p>Garcia was charged in the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore County with two counts of first degree murder on September 11, 2006. A federal arrest warrant has been issued for Garcia and he has been charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.<\/p>",

The two had been at this location, which was extremely dark, for a short time, waiting for a friend, before falling asleep in the vehicle. Their seats were reclined and the vehicle was off. Both had recently left from a bar and had been drinking that night. While asleep in the car, the victim was awoken to a knock on the driver door window. The subject at the window identified himself as a police officer and began questioning the two about a possible DUI. The suspect requested the victim\u2019s license, registration and insurance. The victim was directed out of the vehicle and brought to the rear of her car. The victim was further questioned and \"frisked\" on the inside of her legs and breasts. The suspect told the victim that because the keys were in the ignition, she could face a DUI charge. The victim questioned the suspect as to his name and badge number but was told to stop asking or she would be handcuffed and arrested. The suspect directed the victim to come with him to his patrol vehicle to submit to a portable breath test. The suspect walked the victim to a nearby alley where he pushed her against a telephone pole. The suspect first digitally penetrated the victim and then sexually assaulted (penile) her. The victim cried out, which her friend heard, and then the friend called out for her and the suspect ran off. The suspect fled from the assault area on foot.<\/p>",

            "caution": "<p>Joseph Wayne McCool is being sought for his alleged involvement in a ponzi scheme that was based out of Mesa, Arizona. Sometime before February, 2004, McCool allegedly conspired with two other individuals, who have since been arrested, to operate The Brixon Group, Ltd., which fraudulently solicited millions of dollars from the public. McCool solicited and induced members of the public to invest approximately $10 million in Brixon by making fraudulent and misleading representations concerning how the money would be used, the rates of return, the security of the investments, and their own qualifications to conduct such investments.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>Reportedly, McCool promised investors that their money would be invested in European investment programs and used as reserves for high-yield insurance company portfolio investments. Investors were told that Brixon would generate returns of 10 percent per month. Investors were also falsely promised that they could not lose their principal investment because the principal was insured by the State Bar of California. Furthermore, McCool was represented to investors as a banking expert who successfully managed a large private trust in Europe before operating Brixon.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>Additionally, McCool reportedly failed to disclose to investors that he did not invest money for the benefit of the investors; instead, he allegedly converted a substantial portion of the invested money for personal use and used new funds received by Brixon to make payments to earlier investors. Additionally, investors' money was never insured against loss. When Brixon failed to make promised payments to investors, McCool responded by telling investors that the money was tied up in Europe due to the United States Patriot Act and various international banking problems.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>On May 11, 2006, a federal arrest warrant was issued by the United States District Court for the Southern District of California after McCool was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud. <\/p>",

The scheme involved promising victims investment funding, supposedly being offered by a commercial bank, and supposedly sponsored by the U.S. Government, in exchange of paying various advance fees. Using fake email accounts and stolen identities of bank employees and U.S. government officials, Igwilo and his co-conspirators found victims over the Internet, and allegedly deceived them into believing the investment opportunities were authentic. To further boost victims' belief in the legitimacy of the investment, Igwilo allegedly recruited U.S. citizens to impersonate bank officials during in-person meetings with the victims.<\/p>\r\n<p>Igwilo perpetrated approximately a 100 million dollar fraud scheme defrauding multiple U.S. financial institutions. Igwilo furthered his crime by targeting international victims that would be vulnerable to his criminal scheme.<\/p>\r\n<p>On December 21, 2016, a criminal complaint was filed in the United States District Court, Southern District of Texas, Houston, Texas, charging Igwilo with wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering, and aggravated identity theft.<\/p>",

Such advertisements contained images and descriptions of vehicles and other items for sale, but those items did not really exist. Conspirators posing as sellers then negotiated via e-mail with unsuspecting buyers in the United States. These \"sellers\" sent fraudulent invoices, that appeared to be from legitimate online payment services, to the victim buyers, with instructions for payment to bank accounts held by other conspirators in the United States. These conspirators opened United States bank accounts under false identities using fraudulent passports made in Europe by other conspirators. When victims wired money to an account identified on the false invoices, the conspirator associated with that account would be notified and then would withdraw the proceeds and send them via wire transfer to another conspirator based on e-mailed instructions.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>A federal arrest warrant was issued for Nicolae Popescu on December 20, 2012, in the United States District Court, Eastern District of New York, Brooklyn, New York, after he was charged by indictment for Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud, Money Laundering, Passport Fraud, and Trafficking in Counterfeit Service Marks; Wire Fraud; Money Laundering; Passport Fraud; and Trafficking in Counterfeit Service Marks.<\/p>",

Shortly after the plane took off, Montfort allegedly instructed a passenger to take a note to a flight attendant. When the passenger read the note, Montfort allegedly announced that he had a bomb and wanted to go to Cuba. Those on board the aircraft observed Montfort holding a small, plastic box with possibly a battery taped to its side and a wire or string that had a wire loop on the end through which he had placed his finger. Montfort's demands were relayed to the Captain of the plane, who then diverted his route and flew the plane to Havana, Cuba.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>A federal arrest warrant was issued for Montfort in the United States District Court, Eastern District of New York, on June 28, 1984, after he was charged with aircraft piracy.<\/p>",

A seventeen count felony complaint was filed in February of 2002 in the Superior Court of California, County of Placer, alleging the sexual assault charges. Clifford pleaded \"no contest\" to three of the counts, but failed to appear for his January 28, 2003, sentencing. On August 4, 2004, a federal unlawful flight to avoid prosecution complaint was obtained in the United States District Court, Eastern District of California, Sacramento, California, based on the multiple state charges of sexual assault.<\/p>",

Chaquetin was an alleged member of a drug cartel enforcement crew known as Los Palillos. This gang originally operated under the Arellano Felix Organization (AFO), a drug-trafficking organization in Tijuana, Mexico. It is reported that after leadership in the AFO was arrested, members of the Los Palillos fled to the United States and continued to operate as an independent gang, with an established drug distribution headquartered in San Diego County. This gang was suspected of kidnapping, torturing, and murdering nine people in San Diego County. And, between 2004-2007, Chaquetin allegedly participated in the abductions and murders.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>On August 26, 2009, an arrest warrant was issued for Laureano-Arvizu, by the Superior Court of California, County of San Diego. He was charged with the following crimes: murder; attempted murder of a police officer; kidnapping for ransom; robbery; attempted kidnapping; shooting at an inhabited occupied structure; attempted robbery; and conspiracy to commit kidnapping for ransom. A federal arrest warrant was issued on December 3, 2014, by the United States District Court, Southern District of California, after Laureano-Arvizu was charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.<\/p>",

At the time, Chesimard was wanted for her involvement in several felonies, including bank robbery. Chesimard and her accomplices opened fire on the troopers. One trooper was wounded and the other was shot and killed execution-style at point-blank range. Chesimard fled the scene, but was subsequently apprehended. One of her accomplices was killed in the shoot-out and the other was also apprehended and remains in jail.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>In 1977, Chesimard was found guilty of first degree murder, assault and battery of a police officer, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault with intent to kill, illegal possession of a weapon, and armed robbery.

They promised to invest the proceeds of the home sales, but instead the Dimitrions used the victims' money to fund their own lavish lifestyles.

They promised to invest the proceeds of the home sales, but instead the Dimitrions used the victims' money to fund their own lavish lifestyles. As a result, multiple families in Oahu, Hawaii, lost their homes. The Dimitrions were scheduled to be sentenced in the United States District Court in Honolulu, Hawaii, on July 6, 2010, but failed to appear at the sentencing.

The criminal acts in the conspiracy involve acts committed by Diaz-Juarez and others against undocumented Mexican women and children. The sex-trafficking conspiracy operated from 1999 through October 2013 and relied on \u201cpadrotes,\u201d or pimps, to supply women and girls for the brothels, bars, and cantinas owned and operated by co-conspirators. Diaz-Juarez is one of these pimps. During the investigation, it was revealed that some women and girls were compelled into performing commercial sex acts through the use of force, fraud, coercion, or a combination thereof, including the use of locked rooms to maintain control over the young women and girls. Diaz-Juarez used force and/or violence to punish and control young females he prostituted in the Houston area.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>On October 10, 2013, a federal arrest warrant was issued by the United States District Court, Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, after Diaz-Juarez was charged with sex-trafficking conspiracy and conspiracy to harbor illegal aliens.<\/p>",

It is alleged that from December 2006 to October 2008, through fake advertisements placed on legitimate companies\u2019 websites, Jain and his accomplices deceived internet users into believing that their computers were infected with \u201cmalware\u201d or had other critical errors in order to encourage them to purchase \u201cscareware\u201d software products that had limited or no ability to remedy the purported defects.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>Jain and his co-conspirators allegedly deceived victims, through browser hijacking, multiple fraudulent scans and false error messages, into purchasing full paid versions of software products offered by their company, Innovative Marketing, Inc. The proceeds of these credit card sales were allegedly deposited into bank accounts controlled by the defendant and others around the world, and were then transferred to bank accounts located in Europe. When customers complained that their purchases were actually fraudulent software, call center representatives were allegedly instructed to lie or provide refunds in order to prevent fraud reports to law enforcement or credit companies.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>On May 26, 2010, Jain was indicted in Chicago, Illinois, by a federal grand jury for the United States District Court, Northern District of Illinois.

When the 19-year-old victim arrived at the hotel on November 10, 2007, Guevara-Mejia allegedly attempted to force her into the room. A bystander heard the victim scream for help and attempted to intervene on her behalf. At that time, Guevara-Mejia allegedly pulled out a handgun and fired a shot at the bystander, who was not injured. Guevara-Mejia then succeeded in forcing the victim into the hotel room where he allegedly forced her onto the bed and shot her in her right foot and then the left foot. He then allegedly aimed the weapon at her chest and fired at least three more rounds into her torso. The victim survived her injuries.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>On November 13, 2007, a local arrest warrant was issued for Guevara-Mejia by the Superior Court of California, Davis, California, charging him with attempted murder, false imprisonment, assault with a deadly weapon, and possession of deadly weapon. On January 22, 2008, a federal arrest warrant was issued in the United States District Court, Eastern District of California, Sacramento, California, and Guevara-Mejia was charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.<\/p>",

On June 24, 2002, according to his victim, Richard Marc Evonitz, a white male, age 38 years old, abducted a 15 year-old girl in Columbia, South Carolina, and imprisoned her in his apartment for approximately 18 hours while he repeatedly sexually assaulted her. The victim was able to escape and Evonitz fled to Sarasota, Florida, where he committed suicide after being surrounded by law enforcement authorities. Consequently, a trial and conviction of Evonitz for this and the below crimes to which he is linked is not possible.<\/p>\r\n<p>Subsequent investigation revealed that Evonitz had previously lived in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, and a search of his residence uncovered forensic evidence identifying Evonitz as the offender responsible for the murders of Sofia Silva (September 9, 1996), and Kristen and Kati Lisk (May 1, 1997) in Spotsylvania County.<\/p>",

From approximately 2004 through 2006, the Wolfs established approximately two dozen Florida corporations, one of which was Sky Development Group (SDG), to conduct the fraudulent investment scheme. SDG targeted Americans and Russian immigrants, luring them to invest in real estate with promises of high rates of return on their investments, and cheap available land. SDG also resold land that had been previously sold without the knowledge or consent of the owners. The Wolfs also issued fraudulent deeds and other documents to investors and buyers.

The couple never married and in June of 2001 the relationship ended. The two became embroiled in a very lengthy and aggressive custody-visitation dispute in the San Diego Family Court. In early November of 2004, the mother reportedly mentioned to the father that she and the children were planning a 2-week vacation in New Zealand. He told her that the trip would violate the court orders, and Fernandez's attorney was served with a notice of an ex-parte hearing scheduled for November 8, 2004. At the hearing, a judge ordered that neither parent could take the children out of the jurisdiction of the court and that the children's passports were to be relinquished. The passports were never returned. Also, in November it was reported that Fernandez abruptly left her job and a relative filed a missing person's report for her. Fernandez may have fled with her children to the Philippines.<br /> <br /> On December 9, 2004, a state warrant was issued in the state of California, San Diego County, charging Francina Dacanay Fernandez with three counts of child abduction. A federal arrest warrant was subsequently issued on February 4, 2005, in the United States District Court, Southern District of California, charging Fernandez with international parental kidnapping.<\/p>",

The software was used to capture bank account numbers, passwords, personal identification numbers, and other information necessary to log into online banking accounts. While Bogachev knowingly acted in a role as an administrator, others involved in the scheme conspired to distribute spam and phishing emails, which contained links to compromised web sites. Victims who visited these web sites were infected with the malware, which Bogachev and others utilized to steal money from the victims\u2019 bank accounts. This online account takeover fraud has been investigated by the FBI since the summer of 2009.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>Starting in September of 2011, the FBI began investigating a modified version of the Zeus Trojan, known as GameOver Zeus (GOZ).

On May 19, 2014, Bogachev was indicted in his true name by a federal grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania on charges of Conspiracy; Computer Fraud; Wire Fraud; Bank Fraud; and Money Laundering.

            "caution": "<p>Viet Quoc Nguyen is wanted for allegedly hacking into at least eight E-Mail Service Providers (ESPs) and stealing confidential information, including proprietary marketing data containing over one billion e-mail addresses. The ESPs were located all over the United States, including two based in the Northern District of Georgia. The massive data breach occurred between approximately February of 2009 and June of 2012. During that time, Nguyen allegedly hacked into the ESPs' computer databases and used his unauthorized access to launch spam attacks on tens of millions of e-mail recipients who had their addresses stolen. Additionally, Nguyen also allegedly entered into an arrangement that allowed him to generate revenue from his computer hacks by receiving a commission on sales generated from Internet traffic that he directed to websites promoting specific products.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>A federal arrest warrant for Nguyen was issued on October 3, 2012, in the United States District Court, Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta, Georgia, after a federal grand jury indicted him and he was charged with wire fraud conspiracy for the computer intrusion.<\/p>",

On August 22, 1989, Rayshon Omar Alexxander was transported from his residence in Fort Bliss, Texas, to an army medical center with injuries. Alexxander was pronounced dead on the same date by physicians at the medical facility. Additionally, examination of the victim disclosed numerous bruises throughout his body, which indicated a fractured skull and possible physical abuse. An autopsy later revealed that Alexxander died as a result of extensive child abuse.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>Godbolt-Molder was arrested and indicted by a Western District of Texas Federal Grand Jury at El Paso, Texas, for homicide on a government reservation. Godbolt-Molder was released on bond on October 4, 1989. After Godbolt-Molder violated the terms of her release, by failing to report to her Pre-trial Service Officer while her trial was still pending, her bond was revoked on April 27, 1993. A federal warrant was then issued by the United States District Court, Western District of Texas, for Godbolt-Molder's arrest.<\/p>",

The family moved to the United States where a third child was born in Delaware in 1999, after which time the entire family became citizens of the United States. In 2004, Defensor and his wife separated and shared custody of the children, with the court stipulating that the children could not be removed from the United States. In 2005 and without the knowledge of his ex-wife, Defensor was granted full custody of the children in Philippines courts. Sometime between May 22 and May 24, 2005, Defensor fled to the Philippines with his children. On May 27, 2005, Delaware Family Court granted full custody of the three children to Defensor's ex-wife. In August of 2005, a local arrest warrant was issued for Defensor in the State of Delaware for felony interference with custody. Then, on December 16, 2011, a federal arrest warrant was issued for Defensor in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Wilmington, Delaware, after he was charged with international parental kidnapping.<\/p>",

It is alleged that Iglesias controlled the business activities of the company, including the submission of DME claims to Medicare. Iglesias also had signature authority on the Affordable Medical Services Group bank account where all Medicare deposits were made. From 2007 to 2008, Iglesias allegedly submitted 354 fraudulent claims to Medicare for prosthetic limbs.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>On September 24, 2008, a federal arrest warrant was issued for Iglesias by the United States District Court, District of Puerto Rico, after he was indicted federally for health care fraud-related crimes.<\/p>",

He created various hedge funds and expanded his business by attracting new investors through networking groups and personal referrals. Germenis eventually lost substantial sums of money due to poor investment choices, gambling, and the use of his clients' money to fund a lavish lifestyle. He then allegedly sent his clients falsified financial statements showing excellent investment returns, which led to more investment money from his victims.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>The fraud collapsed when one of his largest investors sought to withdraw money from one of the hedge funds. The majority of those doing business with Germenis were middle-class people, and some were senior citizens who invested and lost their entire life savings. Together, more than twenty-five victims lost over eight million dollars.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>Germenis disappeared in October of 2006. After telling his family that he was going to a baseball game, Germenis drove to JFK Airport in New York and boarded a flight to Athens, Greece. He has not been seen or heard from since.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>On September 27, 2007, Germenis was charged with fraud by wire and a federal arrest warrant was issued by the United States District Court, Eastern District of New York, in Brooklyn, New York.<\/p>",

However, the investors were unable to liquidate accounts and company employees conducted unauthorized transactions on their behalf. Throughout that time, Ferreira was on supervised release in connection with a prior federal sentence and concealed his involvement in these firms from authorities.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>On November 30, 2010, Ferreira was indicted for obstruction of justice, making false statements and conspiracy to obstruct justice, and he was arrested on December 7, 2010.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>In January 2011, Ferreira pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit witness tampering. On April 18, 2011, Ferreira was sentenced to 33 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. Ferreira was released after sentencing and was scheduled to appear in prison no later than August 29, 2011. Ferreira was given electronic monitoring with curfew, however, on or about May 19, 2011, Ferreira did not report home for curfew and a federal warrant was issued for his arrest the next day.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>On August 29, 2011, Ferreira failed to report to prison to begin serving his sentence.

That organization allegedly is responsible for the delivery of more than one-hundred kilograms of cocaine in Arkansas.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>On May 2, 2013, a federal indictment was handed down by a Federal Grand Jury for the United States District Court, Eastern District of Arkansas, charging Ramos-Rangel with multiple drug offenses, including conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, distribution of cocaine, and use of a telephone to facilitate a drug-trafficking crime. On that same day, a federal warrant was issued in Arkansas for Ramos-Rangel's arrest. On June 6, 2013, another federal warrant was issued for Ramos-Rangel's arrest following additional federal drug charges (superseding indictment) obtained for other members of Ramos-Rangel's conspiracy. Ramos-Rangel is also facing federal drug charges in Texas.<\/p>\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<p>The federal indictments resulted from a large-scale investigation, codenamed Operation Dirty Bird, that disrupted cocaine and narcotics trafficking from Mexico to the United States. Multi-tons of cocaine and marijuana are alleged to have been trafficked and distributed throughout the United States, in connection with Ramos-Rangel's alleged drug-trafficking activities.<\/p>",

The murder reportedly resulted from an ongoing personal dispute. On June 3, 1999, a state arrest warrant was issued by the District Court of Marshall County, Alabama, after Martinez was charged with murder. He was charged federally with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, and a federal warrant was issued for his arrest. Martinez is believed to have fled from Albertville in a vehicle which was later found abandoned near Interstate 59 and Rainsville, Alabama. Martinez may have fled to Mexico, but is believed to maintain contact with individuals currently in the United States.<\/p>",
